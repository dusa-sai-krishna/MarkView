# 🚀 Introduction to Spring Boot

Spring Boot is an open-source Java-based framework used to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring applications with minimal configuration.

## 🌟 Features

- **Auto Configuration**: Automatically configures your application based on the dependencies you add.
- **Embedded Servers**: Comes with embedded Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow—no need for external deployment.
- **Production Ready**: Includes metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration.
- **Opinionated Defaults**: Reduces boilerplate and speeds up development.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

To create a Spring Boot application, you can use [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/):

```bash
curl https://start.spring.io/starter.zip \
  -d dependencies=web \
  -d name=demo \
  -o demo.zip
